An ASCII Salvador Dali in your computer.

### Install these packages via pip beforehand:
- requests
- regex
- bs4
- google_images_download

### Important:

- The Google Images API may become overloaded if called too often - be aware of this! Called too many times, it may crash.
- Python 3.7 and beyond is recommended. Earlier versions are not guaranteed to work.
- In order for the main module (artist.py) to run, you need to run Install Certificates (Install Certificates.command).
